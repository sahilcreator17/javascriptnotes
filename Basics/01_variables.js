// Variables defined by 2 ways - 1. let 2. const 3. var(not used anymore)


// 1. let = it will allow you to store any value and also allow you to change the value in future


let firstName = "Avinash"

// to display in terminal we use console.log()

console.log(firstName)

// Note -- whenever you define a variable you can not redefine it

// firstName = 23

// console.log(firstName)
// console.log(firstName)
// console.log(firstName)
// console.log(firstName)


// 2. const = it will allow you to create but never allow you to change its value in future

const age = 32

console.log(age);

// age = 44

// console.log(age);

// 3. var = it will allow you to create and change its value in future

// var lastName = "Dubey"

// This is not used because of global scope and block scope
